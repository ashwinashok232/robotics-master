# Classifier Implementation

## Description
Given the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, trains a linear classifier with stochastic gradient descent to predict
whether a tumor is malginant or denign. Confusion matrices are usde to find accuracy, precision, and recall to gauge the
effectiveness of the model. For testing, cross-validation was used in conjunction with the confusion matrices to find the
average performance metrics for different iterations of cross validation. The ROC curve was also studied as an alternative
performance metric.


# Implementation
All tasks were done on Jupyter, and details of implementation are shown in the ipynb file.
